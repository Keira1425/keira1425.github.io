. . . when we were in college. We were just ordinary classmates until when our third year came, little did I know, it'll be the beginning of my new journey. 
   Keith is a really kind person, smart, jolly and God-fearing. Many people admire him for that, and I am one of them. One day, while waiting for our next class, he shared something that I've never heard of -- the Gospel. It was hard for me that time to listen to him share his beliefs and the church he belongs to, but weeks then months went by and still, he didn't gave up on me. We became closer as time went by and we even became bestfriends. He kept on reading me scriptures, he plays the piano and sings to me church's songs, he even accompanied me to  church and even there are already missionaries teaching me, he was still there. He helped me to get closer with Our Heavenly Father and he helped me to become a better person. Thats when I knew that he is the one that I have always prayed for.
   We became a couple on December 25, 2014. It was the most beautiful time of the year indeed! 😊 Just like every other relationship, we fight, we argue, we compromise. We believe that we should always choose our love. Choose our love over anger and pride. We've experienced challenges in our relationship, we've experienced ups and downs together but I know that with the help of Heavenly Father, it will all work out. 
   The best times to show true love are when it isn't easy. Let me share with you what Elder Jeffrey Holland once said, "If you want something to last for eternity, you treat it differently. You shield it and protect it. You never abused it. You don't expose it to the elements. You don't make it common or ordinary. If it ever becomes tarnished, you lovingly polished it until it gleams like new. It becomes special because you have made it so, and it grows more beautiful and precious as time goes by."
